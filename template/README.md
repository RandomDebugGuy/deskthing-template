# Deskthing App Template

You have created your own DeskThing app!

The structure of your app is as follows:
```
YourAppRoot/
├── public/
|   ├── manifest.json // Your app info
|   └── icons
|      └── yourapp.svg // Your app icon, shows up on the client
├── server/
|   └── index.ts // The main file of the backend
├── src/
|   ├── App.tsx // React client UI
|   ├── index.css
|   └── main.tsx
└── index.html
```
The rest of the files you do not need to worry about.
